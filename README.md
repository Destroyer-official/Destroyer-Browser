### 📚 How It Works

Destroyer Browser is built on the PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine frameworks, utilizing Python for scripting. The browser's core functionality revolves around the following key components:

1. **Tabbed Browsing:**
   - Destroyer Browser enables users to open multiple tabs, each representing a different website or web resource.
   - The tabbed interface allows for convenient multitasking and efficient organization of browsing activities.

2. **Navigation Controls:**
   - Back, forward, reload, and home buttons provide users with intuitive navigation controls for a seamless browsing experience.
   - These controls are implemented using PyQt5 signals and actions, ensuring responsive interaction with the web content.

3. **Privacy and Security:**
   - Destroyer Browser prioritizes user privacy by incorporating an incognito mode.
   - While in incognito mode, the browser ensures that no user data, including browsing history, cookies, or cached data, is stored on the device.

4. **OSINT Tools Integration:**
   - The browser comes equipped with a set of OSINT tools to empower users in gathering information online.
   - Each tool, such as Shodan, DNSDumpster, and VirusTotal, is seamlessly integrated to provide quick access to relevant information.

5. **Data Removal on Exit:**
   - To enhance privacy, all browsing history, cookies, and cached data are automatically removed when the user exits the browser.
   - This feature ensures that no trace of the user's online activity remains on the device.

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - Destroyer Browser adjusts dynamically to the window size, offering a responsive design that adapts to various screen dimensions.
   - This responsiveness ensures a consistent and user-friendly browsing interface across different devices.

7. **Script Execution:**
   - The browser script is executed using Python, leveraging the capabilities of PyQt5 and PyQtWebEngine for web rendering and user interface components.
   - The use of Python provides flexibility and ease of development for both the browser's core features and additional functionalities.

This combination of features makes Destroyer Browser a versatile and privacy-focused web browser with a range of tools for users interested in Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) activities.
